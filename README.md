# Docker CI/CD Pipeline with Python

## Overview

This repository contains a evolutionary tutorial guide that teaches you how to:

- Create a sample Python application
- Create a new Dockerfile which contains instructions required to build a Python image
- Build an image and run the newly built image as a container
- Set up volumes and networking
- Orchestrate containers using Compose
- Use containers for development
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline for your application using GitHub Actions
- Deploy your application to the cloud (https://docs.docker.com/language/python/deploy/):
    - Docker AWS ECS integration - https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/
        - The Docker ECS Integration enables developers to use native Docker commands in the Docker Compose CLI to run applications in an Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) when building cloud-native applications.
    - Kubernetes - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/
        - Docker Desktop includes a standalone Kubernetes server and client, as well as Docker CLI integration that runs on your machine. When you enable Kubernetes, you can test your workloads on Kubernetes.

After completing the Python getting started modules, you should be able to containerize your own Python application based on the examples and instructions provided in this guide.
